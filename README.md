# Number Guessing Game

## Description
This is a simple C++-based number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it. The program provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.

## Features

- Provides hints to guide the user.
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
3. The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
